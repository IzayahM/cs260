This program will add/ subtract colored marbles to a bag.

a marble will be represented with an integer value corresponding to a color ex. red = 1 green = 2 blue = 3
this could be done with a bag class that has attributes that are different colors as well as bag size.

the program will ask which color of marble they would like to add by entering the corresponding number and then how many marbles to add with a cap of 20
this will be done by calling add_marb(int color, int quant)
if(color == 1)
red += quant;

The program will also be able to subtract marbles by using the same method as mentioned before.
the function that this would use is sub_marb(int color, int quant)
if(color == 1)
red -= quant;
