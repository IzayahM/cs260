This program will be a linked queue data structure. 

it will use a hpp file for the queue and node classes.
The node class will have an id and a pointer pointing to the next node. 

The queue class will have a pointer pointing to the front and the rear of the queue which will initially both be set to null.
This class will feature an enqueue and dequeue function.
The enqueue function will create a new node, if the queue is empty both front and rear pointers will point to this node.
If the queue has an item existing it will point to the rear of the queue.
The dequeue function will first check to see if the queue is empty.
If it is not it will take the first element and point it to a temporary pointer, it will then take the front and point it to the next in the queue then delete the temp pointer.

to compile this: g++ main.cpp node.cpp queue.cpp -o queue_test

The time complexity of this program I think is O(1) for each function because I am not traversing the queue we are just accessing specific points of the queue.
